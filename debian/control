Description: Text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading
 Mutt is a sophisticated text-based Mail User Agent. Some highlights:
  o MIME support (including RFC1522 encoding/decoding of 8-bit message
    headers and UTF-8 support).
  o PGP/MIME support (RFC 2015).
  o Advanced IMAP client supporting SSL encryption and SASL authentication.
  o POP3 support.
  o Mailbox threading (both strict and non-strict).
  o Default keybindings are much like ELM.
  o Keybindings are configurable; Mush and PINE-like ones are provided as
    examples.
  o Handles MMDF, MH and Maildir in addition to regular mbox format.
  o Messages may be (indefinitely) postponed.
  o Colour support.
  o Highly configurable through easy but powerful rc file.
