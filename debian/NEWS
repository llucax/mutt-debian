mutt (1.5.14+cvs20070301-1) experimental; urgency=low

  We no longer unset write_bcc in /etc/Muttrc. If your MTA does not strip Bcc:
  headers, edit /etc/Muttrc. (exim4 and postfix strip them, exim(3) does not.)
  We also no longer unset use_from and use_domain. Mutt will use the contents
  of /etc/mailname to determine the domain part of the From: header.

  This release adds ESMTP support to mutt. To use, set smtp_url to your
  smarthost, e.g. smtps://mail.company.com/.

  The gpgme crypt backend is now enabled.

mutt (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In this release the alternates, lists, and subscribe configuration
  variables have been turned into regular expression lists.
  Additionaly, alternates is now an option, not a  variable.
  This means that you should change:

  set alternates="foo|bar"

  into

  alternates "foo|bar"

  in your .muttrc file. See muttrc(5) for details.
