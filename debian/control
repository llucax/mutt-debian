Description: text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading
 Mutt is a sophisticated text-based Mail User Agent. Some highlights:
 .
  * MIME support (including RFC1522 encoding/decoding of 8-bit message
    headers and UTF-8 support).
  * PGP/MIME support (RFC 2015).
  * Advanced IMAP client supporting SSL encryption and SASL authentication.
  * POP3 support.
  * Mailbox threading (both strict and non-strict).
  * Default keybindings are much like ELM.
  * Keybindings are configurable; Mush and PINE-like ones are provided as
    examples.
  * Handles MMDF, MH and Maildir in addition to regular mbox format.
  * Messages may be (indefinitely) postponed.
  * Colour support.
  * Highly configurable through easy but powerful rc file.
