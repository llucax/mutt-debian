mutt (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

 In this release the alternates, lists, and subscribe configuration
 variables have been turned into regular expression lists.
 Additionaly, alternates is now an option, not a  variable.
 This means that you should change:

 set alternates="foo|bar"

 into

 alternates "foo|bar"

 in your .muttrc file. See muttrc(5) for details.
